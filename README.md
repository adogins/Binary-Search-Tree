## instructions
- Please compile BST.java before compliing BSTTester.java as BSTTester.java is dependent on BST.java.
- Also feel free to run these files in the terminal. I personally used Visual Studio Code which I find to work well too. 
- Feel free to enter numbers with the general test or modify any of the other tests I made. Or use a different tester that I didn't make.
