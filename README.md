## instructions
- Please compile BST.java before compliing BSTTester.java as BSTTester.java is dependent on BST.java.
- Also feel free to run these files in the terminal. I personally used Visual Studio Code which I find to work well too. 
- Feel free to enter numbers with the general test or modify any of the other tests I made. Or use a different tester that I didn't make. 
- If you use the general test know that if you enter a number to delete that's not in the tree then the entire test will stop and print the element is not found. If you run the regular tests I made then you'll see where it says the element is not found and moved on in with the rest of the code. 

## Group Memebers if any
- I chose to work alone on this project.
## Other Notes
- I made a few private methods to make make it easier to identify the nodes. Such methods include a search method.
- For preorder, postorder, and inorder, I used recursion in private methods and called those recursive methods in the respective public methods. 
- While writing the code, I referenced the BST slides on eLC. I also followed the algorithms listed on the eLC slides and added logic I found to be necessary. Some of my testing examples use the numbers from the slides that show preorder, postorder, and inorder to ensure my code was printing out correctly.
