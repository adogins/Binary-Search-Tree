## instructions
- Please compile BST.java before compliing BSTTester.java as BSTTester.java is dependent on BST.java.
- Also feel free to run these files in the terminal. I personally used Visual Studio Code which I find to work well too. 

## Group Memebers if any
- I chose to work alone on this project.
## Other Notes
- I made a few private methods to make make it easier to identify the nodes. Such methods include a search method, a method to find the leftmost node and a method to find the rightmost node. 
- For preorder, postorder, and inorder, I used recursion in private methods and called those recursive methods in the respective public methods.
